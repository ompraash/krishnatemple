       <para1>Appearance Anniversary of Sri Nityananda Prabhu</br>
       In the sixteenth century Lord Nityananda Prabhu graced the earth together with Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to give freely the treasure of God's love. 
       These two effulgent personalities were compared to the sun and moon, who would dissipate the darkness of the world. They taught people the fundamental process of connecting with God in this age: the chanting of Krishna's holy names. 
       Nityananda Prabhu captivated the people of Navadvipa, West Bengal, while he danced and chanted in the streets. 
       As an incarnation of Lord Balarama, Lord Krishna's brother, Nityananda Prabhu is described as the most compassionate personality, who non-discriminately gives his blessing and kindness to all.
