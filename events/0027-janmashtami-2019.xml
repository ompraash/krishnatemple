   <eventbdesc>This day is being celebrated as the Birth­day of Krishna, not for the reason that Krishna is being born every year, but, be­cause the hour, the asterisk, the month and the season during which he was born ages ago, recur every year, and this day, we have the same conjunction as happened when he was born millennia ago. </eventbdesc>
