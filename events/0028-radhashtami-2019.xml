     <para1>Radha Ashtami is an extremely joyous occasion held every year. This festival is celebrated with the same zeal as Lord Krishna’s birth anniversary. The love between Radha and Krishna is eternal and can only be understood after overcoming all the worldly impurities. This unique unison symbolises how an individual soul merges with the supreme soul. Radha signifies individual soul and Lord Krishna is the universal soul. It is known that Radha and Krishna exist together and are referred as 'Radhakrishna'.</para1>
